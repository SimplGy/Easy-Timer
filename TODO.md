## Today

## On Deck
- [ ] **Ring** a beautiful chime when done

## Someday, Over the Rainbow
- [ ] **Snap** into common times like 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60
- [ ] **Curve Time**. Don't scale the time linearly (1 and 5 and 10 need lots of visual room, later times don't)
- [ ] **Physical**. Get a feeling of momentum and physicality while dragging.
- [ ] **Teach** the user that there is a timer there by animating it on app launch
- [ ] **Sinebow** for beautiful colors
- [ ] **Forshadow**. Show urgency by changing color on a scale from set time (not total time) to 0

## Questions
* If `typealias SystemSoundID = UInt32` Why is `Int` not convertable to a `SystemSoundID`?
* Can I play sounds that are on the device already?
